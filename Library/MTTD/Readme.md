Mean-time-to-detect  (MTTD) a breach is 197 days,
and the mean-time-to-contain (MTTC) is 69 days.

These and many other insights into the escalating costs of security breaches are from the 2018 Cost of a Data Breach Study sponsored by IBM Security with research independently conducted by Ponemon Institute LLC.

The study is based on interviews with more than 2,200 compliance, data protection and IT professionals from 477 companies located in 15 countries and regions globally who have experienced a data breach in the last 12 months.

And as the Ponemon 2017 Cost of a Data Breach Study shows, the longer it takes to detect a breach, the more expensive it will be.

The study found that US companies took an average of 206 days to detect a data breach. This is a slight increase on the previous year (201 days).
